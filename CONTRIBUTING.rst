Contributing to Beef
====================

This document explains how to contribute to the project.


Requirements
------------

Changes must be documented, both through comments in the code and
through detailed commit messages.

Large changes should be split into smaller commits that make sense
on their own; the code should compile after each commit has been
applied.

Patches must carry reasonable authorship information, that is, the
full name of the author, and must include a ``Signed-off-by`` tag as
a way to declare that they are submitted in compliance with the
`Developer Certificate of Origin`_.


Submitting patches
------------------

Patches can be submitted for consideration via `email`_, preferably
using `git-publish`_; if you would rather use a more Web-oriented
workflow, submission through `gitlab`_ or `github`_ is also accepted.
